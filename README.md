# Löve cards

A simple local two player card game which works like a more advanced version of rock paper scissors. 
Difference being all cards have an attack stat and some have power ups that stack up to three times.

This was my first finished project in Löve/love2D and in lua so the code is very unorganized and some generally bad coding practices.
I also set a deadline for my self which resulted in crunching to 4:30am which is visible from some of the comments that cam from pure frustration.
